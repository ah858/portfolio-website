This is obvious at blossom time: a domino of trees bloom from plum to the late cherry trees. We started planning weekends around bloom charts like train timetables."

Plum blossoms were easier because the pink holds detail, while with cherry I leaned on close, macro frames. The Hakone shot is inspired by LA photographer @filmwavecherry's deeply saturated work."
